using git bash, to login as a user use:
    psql -U postgres

\q => to quit
\l => to list




create data base
    CREATE DATABASE thedb;

to login to a dbserver
the way to remember the order is to is to loook at it alphabetically
    psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres dbserver


to login to a database under a particular user:
    \c thedb

to delete database, the most dangerous code is the:
    DROP DATABASE test;

to create a table:
        CREATE TABLE person (
        id INT,
        first_name VARCHAR(50),
        last_name VARCHAR(50),
        gender VARCHAR(7),
        date_of_birth DATE,
        );
    then it will CREATE TABLE

\d => to list all the tables in the database


\d thetable => to view the table name



 this table is with constraints
CREATE TABLE person (
id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
gender VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(150)
);

bogserial manages the increments

this to insert a person or a role in the 'person'
INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth)
VALUES('Anne', 'Smith', 'FEMALE', date '1988-01-09');

to sort table:
    assending order by default (ASC)
    SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth;
    by desending
    SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
    SELECT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
 * means all
distinct
      SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
 this will select all the country with no duplicate
